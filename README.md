This is a template project for data synchronization with the hospital HIS system. To synchronize actual data, the logic of the relevant modules in the template needs to be modified. Create a config folder in the same level directory of the data synchronization app file, package the template project into a jar file, and then place the jar file in the config folder created earlier. Finally, when starting the data synchronization app, load the jar by specifying the location of the template, such as: java - jar - DLoader. path="/your/path/config"/ app.jar
